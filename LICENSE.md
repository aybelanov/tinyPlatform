# Commercial License

Independent Software Vendors that want the benefits of embedding tinyPlat software in their commercial applications but do not want to be subject to the tinyPlat Public License ("TPL") and do not want to release the source code for their proprietary applications must purchase a commercial license from the tinyPlat team. Purchasing a commercial license means that the tinyPlat Public License ("TPL") does not apply, and a commercial license includes the assurances that distributors typically find in commercial distribution agreements. If use of tinyPlat under the TPL does not satisfy your organization's legal department you should also enter into a commercial license agreement with the tinyPlat team.
